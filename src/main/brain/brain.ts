// BRAIN: the agent's state machine. It decides what state we're in and where mic audio goes.
// Guide: docs/build-log/04-wake-word.md.

// Pure TypeScript: no Electron, no Gemini SDK, no timers it can't be told about. Everything it does
// to the outside world goes through BrainHooks. That's what makes it unit-testable
// (brain.test.ts runs it with fake hooks, no app needed).
//
// Where mic audio goes, by situation:
//   idle, wake word on      → wake-word spotter only (never leaves the computer)
//   push-to-talk held       → Gemini
//   conversation open       → Gemini (follow-ups without saying the wake word again)
//   speaking + no barge-in  → nowhere (so Gemini can't hear its own voice)
